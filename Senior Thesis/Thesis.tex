Superpages are a contiguous set of virtual pages mapped to a contiguous set of physical frames (typically 2MB or 1GB in size). They allow the processor to use a single TLB entry to express the virtual-to-physical mapping of a large range of addresses, thereby reducing overall TLB misses. Unfortunately, superpages reduce the flexibility for the operating system to efficiently manage memory. Techniques like copy-on-write are much more expensive when superpages are in use because the entire superpage must be copied for even a small write.

Our work examines changes to the TLB that make it possible to gain the advantages of superpages without losing the flexibility of standard pages. In particular, we propose a system called ``superpage overlays'' which allows the system to track modifications to superpages at a page granularity. It does this by appending a bit vector to each page table and TLB entry, indicating which segments of the superpage are mapped to an ``overlay'' instead and are translated via a secondary page table hierarchy.

Our system alleviates the downsides of superpages. Overlays can track small changes in superpages to avoid copying the full superpage or breaking it down into standard pages. Rather than doing a copy-on-write, we can create an overlay on write and only copy one page while preserving the original superpage. To evaluate the proposal we use a trap-driven simulation framework that simulates the behavior of the TLB in situ while benchmarks are running.
