Figure \ref{fig:charts} shows the average time and TLB misses for the different configurations of the benchmark, measured by the Linux perf tool. This benchmark demonstrates the potential for superpage overlays to improve performance. Writing to many 4KB pages is slow due to the high number of TLB misses, but doing copy-on-write with a superpage is slow compared to the 4KB pages when the writes only affect a small amount of memory. Superpage overlays should provide the TLB benefits of superpages while only copying 4KB at a time when the child process writes.
